# CalorieWebApp
Calorie Web App Project

In this project, we develop web app using flask, wtforms, selectorlib and requests libraries.

We get weight, height, age, country and city as input from user using flask and wtforms webapp.

We get current temperature of our provided location i.e. country and city from https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/ using temperature.yaml file.

We pass current temperature which we get from https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/ to calorie to calculate the current Body Mass Index (BMI) of user as per provided inputs.
